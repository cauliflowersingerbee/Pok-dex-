# Pokédex App

A small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

- It uses Bootstrap for UI styling
- It has complex UI patterns (modal & navbar)
- When a modal is triggered, it displays Pokémon details (i.e image, name, height, & type)
